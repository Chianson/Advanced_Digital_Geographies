4. The relcassification database used for my neighborhood layer has 4 ranges split by 20,711,348. This 
   number is used because the highest value in the "AREA" column is 82,845,392. Creating four equal
   intervals makes each interval 20,711,348. This reclassification allows for an easy visualization
   of polygons areas ranging for low to high areas.
